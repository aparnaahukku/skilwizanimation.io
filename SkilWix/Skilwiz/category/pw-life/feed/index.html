				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IGN dropped by our Sydney studio recently to discuss our origin story. Lucy O&#8217;Brien sat down with our Creative Director Nathan Maddams, Executive Vice President Dane Maddams, Executive Producer Felix Crawshaw and Head of Production Mick Hammell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="meaty">On paper, Plastic Wax’s position at the bottom of the world saw it on the back-foot when pitted against other VFX companies based in more tech-centric cities in the USA and the UK. But punching above one’s weight is a highly-regarded Australiasian virtue, and Plastic Wax only embraced the challenge. “All our competitors are international,” says Dane. “So if we don&#8217;t meet that level, that sort of fidelity, we miss out. I think it&#8217;s a big part of why we collaborate very closely, why we’re in tune with the studio and its talent, and being very sort of self aware of what other cinematic studios are doing, and how we can push the limits.”</p>
<p class="meaty">Despite an environment increasingly geared towards in-engine footage &#8211; ‘in-game footage’ text is slapped on E3 demos like a badge of pride &#8211; there appears to be no shortage of opportunities to let Plastic Wax push said limits with pre-rendered animation. On the one hand, explains Nathan, it comes down to manpower; not every studio can afford to set aside its animators for such a huge chunk of time. “As far as feasibility for a company to be able to function, [clients] can outsource to people that are confident with it who can handle that part of things and not have to keep scaling up and scaling up.”</p>
<p class="meaty">On the other hand, cinematics are still used to tell stories, particularly in trailers, and if you’re going to go pre-rendered, you go with the best. “Companies with their own in-house team come to Plastic Wax,” says Crawshaw. “We’ve worked on multiple projects with different styles for different cinematic needs. We look at what story the cinematic needs to tell. They buy into that skill base. And that enhances their IP.”</p>
<p class="meaty" dir="ltr">Today, Plastic Wax continues to be an aggressively sought after VFX studio, with a headcount of roughly 50 based in Rhodes, and San Francisco and LA-based marketing teams at work during the off hours. Nathan tells me there are some long-form projects in the pipeline that he’s very excited about. “We’ll have to have you back,” he says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week our latest project, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Injustice 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Story Trailer “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lines are Redrawn”,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was released and has since been viewed in the tens of millions. It was a pleasure as always to work with our friends at Battery and Warner Bros to tell the compelling story of the Injustice universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When working with such prolific characters with decades of history there are fan expectations we take seriously &#8211; because we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response so far has been phenomenal. We’re floored by the influx of comments and reactions. It’s a rare privilege to witness the direct impact of our work on the audience, and everyone on the team is thankful for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To show our appreciation, we took our favourite moments from the many reaction videos online and created a compilation of our own.</span></p>

<p>We recently spoke to FX Guide about our work on the LEGO Force Awakens trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The recently released all-CG trailer, which mimics the teaser trailer for the feature film &#8211; albeit with LEGO-like embellishments &#8211; has already chalked up more than five million views on official YouTube channels.</em></p>
<p><em>But it also left plenty of people wondering who was behind it. Was it the same team from The LEGO Movie? Was it the game developer TT Games (part of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment)?</em></p>
<p><em>It turns out that a small, but prolific, studio named Plastic Wax in Sydney delivered the announcement trailer. They&#8217;ve had their hand for several years in cutscenes, cinematics and even other LEGO game work.</em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This piece was originally published on <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/03/a-look-behind-the-scenes-how-this-australian-cg-studio-makes-cinematic-trailers/">Gizmodo Australia</a></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s pretty common knowledge that a large number of cinematic trailers are made by external CG studios hired by developers to produce something incredible &#8211; you’ve probably heard of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blur</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example. What might surprise you is process behind these trailers, the technology involved or even that a handful of these AAA trailers are being made here in Sydney, Australia. I’m a Producer at Sydney-based CG studio </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plastic Wax</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Around for the last 20 years, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plastic Wax</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the team behind CG in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunger Games 2, Gears of War, Fallout, Bioshock, Borderlands </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and more. Most recently, you might’ve seen our</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LEGO The Force Awakens</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trailer.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-010.jpg"><img class="wp-image-786 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-010.jpg" alt="Lego Star Wars Teaser Still 010" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-010.jpg 1920w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-010-300x169.jpg 300w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-010-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot of mystery around exactly what a CG studio does, so I’m sitting down with my coworkers at</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Plastic Wax</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get an inside look at the process from start to finish. I’ll be looking into the people and the passion behind each element, and the technology and software that makes it possible. To narrow it down I’ll focus mainly on what goes into the making of a cinematic trailer, but it’s important to note that most CG studios produce a vast variety of content, including the in-engine animation you experience while you’re playing the game.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GearsWIRE.jpg"><img class="wp-image-784  aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GearsWIRE-1024x576.jpg" alt="GearsWIRE" width="590" height="332" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GearsWIRE-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GearsWIRE-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a> <a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GearsFINAL2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-783  aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GearsFINAL2-1024x576.jpg" alt="GearsFINAL2" width="589" height="331" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GearsFINAL2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GearsFINAL2-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every project comes to a studio in a different form. Executive Vice President of Plastic Wax Dane Maddams remembers, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had cinematics that have been a scribble on a napkin. Transformers, for instance. I was in the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood and one of the key directors for Activision had a rough idea that he approached me with and said, ‘What do you think of this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” That napkin scribble became</span> <a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/the_work/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by the way. No big deal. Other projects will obviously be a lot more realised, with some clients providing full storyboards and assets from day one. This initial stage is when all the juicy concept art and sketches are created to lay out the story and feel for the project. Once the storyboard is finalised and the client is happy, it’s time to start bringing it to life.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Capture1.png"><img class="wp-image-780 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Capture1.png" alt="Capture" width="934" height="717" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Capture1.png 934w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Capture1-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the part every cosplayer in the room cares about &#8211; building characters. There’s no one piece of magical software that characters are modelled in, in fact different programs are used for pretty much every imaginable aspect of how a character looks. Hair, pores on skin, cloth, body types and more, all require project-specific software and plug-ins (some completely custom programmed from studio to studio) to get the best result possible. In the very beginning, however, our Lead Modeller Dean Wood explains the two key software-driven paths to character creation.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batmanMESH-copy.jpg"><img class="wp-image-778 size-large aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batmanMESH-copy-1024x1024.jpg" alt="batmanMESH copy" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batmanMESH-copy-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batmanMESH-copy-150x150.jpg 150w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batmanMESH-copy-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a> <a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman.jpg"><img class="wp-image-777 size-large aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-1024x1024.jpg" alt="batman" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-150x150.jpg 150w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D sculpting tool Z-Brush is used for creating more stylised, cartoony characters like LEGO, whereas Marvellous Designer is used for more realism. Marvellous is a particularly interesting program to watch in play due to the amount of detail and authenticity that it can simulate. Dean explains, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll put in a character, which is just a naked base body, and build it as if you were a seamstress. You apply the cloth, then the stitching and lining where it should be and the computer will simulate the elements as if it were a physical object.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s basically like a super crazy high-tech version of making dresses for paper dolls. Whatever you do, do not tell the modelling department I said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly, creating a setting for a CG cinematic trailer is probably the stage that most closely resembles physical filmmaking. Like when building a film set, camera angles are decided ahead of time and the environment is only created within the scope of what can be seen in the shot. Anything out of shot either doesn’t exist, or is extremely low detail. This is where software like World Machine becomes extremely useful. World Machine does what’s called procedural terrain generation &#8211; effectively simulating nature and allowing artists to make changes, add detail and adjust to their needs. Imagine the terrain editor in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sims</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then pretend you didn’t spend 100 hours of your life creating a tropical oasis your Sims to live and mysteriously die in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the characters move and interact with their surroundings falls to the animation team. Contrary to the popular perception, Lead Animator Wes Adams explains </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Animating isn’t really about moving things around and meticulously calculating things. It really is acting, and acting is entertaining people and making them feel something.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most animation sequences in cinematic trailers are short, maybe 30 seconds, so it’s vital that a studio’s animators are able to make it crystal clear exactly what a character is doing and expressing. Facial expressions, posing and actions all have to be perfectly executed to avoid the cinematic having the plot clarity of Halle Berry Catwoman.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7978.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-788 alignright" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7978-300x200.jpg" alt="OW2A7978" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7978-300x200.jpg 300w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7978-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7963.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-787 alignleft" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7963-300x200.jpg" alt="OW2A7963" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7963-300x200.jpg 300w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7963-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular approach to creating realistic animation sequences is of course motion capture. At Plastic Wax, we have a motion capture facility that comprises of 24 Vicon MX40 cameras &#8211; if that doesn’t mean anything to you, basically these cameras are able to capture a super high-fidelity image of the nuances of a mocap performance. Everything down to a microsecond of hesitation shows up in mocap. As someone with all of the grace and co-ordination of a drunk baby this terrifies me so clearly, finding the right talent for mocap performances is vital. Dane Maddams explains the kind of diverse talent required,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the instance of Lara Croft, we hired an Olympic gymnast to execute flips and jumps. For our work on Dawn of War we had special forces agents help us map out exact strategy and movements given the circumstance. For Stalker, we used Bullmastiffs and horses for some of the wild animals.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I eagerly await the day we need to mocap a character eating pizza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this stage you’re probably picking up that the production pipeline for creating a cinematic trailer is kind of like an assembly line building a car. Each department is specifically engineered and placed in the pipeline to be the most time-efficient and produce the highest quality performance. The lighting department’s position in the pipeline is carefully selected, as playing with light around a 3D model makes it easy to identify imperfections. Lighting Lead Ben observes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lighting brings everyone’s work together and that’s where you see the flaws. If the animation or the models or the textures don’t look good, we see it in lighting.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following up lighting, the rendering and VFX teams come into play to add effects like smoke and explosions before the compositing team bring all of it together in a Rocky montage-esque fashion in the final hours.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-ww.png"><img class="wp-image-776 size-large aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-ww-1024x576.png" alt="batman ww" width="1024" height="576" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-ww-1024x576.png 1024w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-ww-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approval process is a unique experience for an external CG studio. Throughout the many stages of production, every element of a cinematic needs to be approved by both the client and the studio Art Director. Effectively capturing the look and feel of the game and ensuring the highest technical and artistic calibre while telling a compelling story is a lot of boxes to tick in one short trailer. Commenting on the importance of having consistently high standards across the board in every stage of development, Plastic Wax Art Director Tyrone Maddams explains, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The core of a cinematic is to be moved, to be wowed, we can only show you in a very short timeframe what a game is about so the goal is for the viewer to have more questions than answers. There’s so much out there, but what stands out above it all is quality in storytelling.”</span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-09.jpg"><img class="wp-image-785 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-09.jpg" alt="Lego Star Wars Teaser Still 09" width="1920" height="1632" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-09.jpg 1920w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-09-300x255.jpg 300w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Lego-Star-Wars-Teaser-Still-09-1024x870.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Art Director’s final seal of approval, the cinematic is ready for release. Launching a trailer can be one of the most impactful stages building up to game’s launch. With the hype-machine in overdrive, the levels of social media engagement and media coverage seen by these trailers are astronomical. Although the size of the audience is humbling, Tyrone Maddams comments that the real point of pride lies within the games themselves. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reward is just being allowed to work on these titles. When I was 10, I played Fallout, the isometric turn-based one. My father purchased a 486 (With 33mhz) pc for my brothers and I, and i watched them play. I never in a million years imagined that I’d one day be working on it. Similar to my experiences as a child playing LEGO, and now our opportunity to infuse the world into Star Wars, Just being able to tell these stories is amazing.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, it also doesn’t hurt when John Boyega tweets about your trailer.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/boyega.png"><img class="wp-image-779 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/boyega.png" alt="boyega" width="675" height="711" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/boyega.png 675w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/boyega-285x300.png 285w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to the future, the power and possibilities of cinematic content only grow as technology like VR and AR evolve into new storytelling mediums, imagery increases in resolution and software becomes more powerful and accessible. Dane Maddams observes that as consumer technology advances, CG studios have remained relevant.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “We’ve always heard, ‘Hey, the Playstation 3 is coming out, you guys are gonna be obsolete!’  But the reality is that storytelling is critical to every platform.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the revenue for the games industry surpassing film, television and music, it’s also hard to deny the thirst for rich, engaging content. The future for cinematic content only continues to grow brighter as technology and software advances, and the audience for video games expands and diversifies.</span><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A celebration of some of our favourite women in games and film, and the women who brought them to life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alien-Ripley-and-Hicks.jpg"><img class="wp-image-791 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alien-Ripley-and-Hicks.jpg" alt="Alien-Ripley-and-Hicks" width="1280" height="688" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alien-Ripley-and-Hicks.jpg 1280w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alien-Ripley-and-Hicks-300x161.jpg 300w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alien-Ripley-and-Hicks-1024x550.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></span></p>
<p><b>Ripley</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alien protagonist portrayed by eternal badass </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sigourney Weaver</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (who earned herself an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academy Award</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nomination for Best Actress,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama, a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Leading Newcomer, and four Saturn Award nominations for Best Actres</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s for the franchise) made film history challenging gender roles, the position of sci-fi and horror genres, and smashing the damsel in distress trope into a thousand tiny pieces.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rey_bddd0f27.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-794 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rey_bddd0f27.jpeg" alt="rey_bddd0f27" width="768" height="431" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rey_bddd0f27.jpeg 768w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rey_bddd0f27-300x168.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Rey</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first woman to step into the starring role in a Star Wars film, Rey has fast become a beloved icon for fans of the franchise the world over. Perhaps even better than the groundbreaking decision to position a female Jedi origin story at the core of the Star Wars continuation, are the women behind bringing her into reality: Daisy Ridley and Kathleen Kennedy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daisy Ridley was basically unknown before being cast as Rey, and has somehow managed to handle being thrust into the brightest of spotlights with unassuming grace, humility and an inspiring humanitarian nature. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathleen Kennedy is a hollywood powerhouse producer and President of Lucasfilm Ltd. Third only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to Spielberg and Stan Lee in domestic box office receipts, having worked on E.T, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Schindler’s List and now Star Wars, Kennedy is basically the epitome of a totally rad boss lady.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BioShock_infinite_burial_at_sea_epiosde_2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-792 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BioShock_infinite_burial_at_sea_epiosde_2.jpg" alt="BioShock_infinite_burial_at_sea_epiosde_2" width="1200" height="594" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BioShock_infinite_burial_at_sea_epiosde_2.jpg 1200w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BioShock_infinite_burial_at_sea_epiosde_2-300x149.jpg 300w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BioShock_infinite_burial_at_sea_epiosde_2-1024x507.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Elizabeth Comstock</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth surprised us all with her story, character development and capabilities in 2013’s BioShock Infinite. Players fears that the gameplay experience would be an “extended escort mission” were quickly dashed when it became evident that Elizabeth had been designed to help you more than you can possibly help her. Praised for her complexity, vulnerability, strength and humanity, Elizabeth stands in a league of her own in a world where female video game characters have a long way to come. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth was voiced by actress Courtnee Draper, who was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nominated for a British Academy Games Award for Performer and won a Spike Video Game Award (Best Song) for her performance of Infinite’s defining song &#8220;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&#8221;. Elizabeth was also brought to life by motion capture performer Heather Gordon, game designer Amanda Jeffrey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and cosplayer Anna Ormelli.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/EIDOS_-Tomb_raider_01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-793 size-full" src="http://www.plasticwax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/EIDOS_-Tomb_raider_01.jpg" alt="EIDOS_ Tomb_raider_01" width="1727" height="1159" srcset="http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/EIDOS_-Tomb_raider_01.jpg 1727w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/EIDOS_-Tomb_raider_01-300x201.jpg 300w, http://2wmur41cisua2s1gjujrkyr1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/EIDOS_-Tomb_raider_01-1024x687.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1727px) 100vw, 1727px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Lara Croft</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What more needs to be said than, “Lara flippin’ Croft”? Synonymous with adventure, bravery, strength and intelligence, Lara is the face of one of the longest running video game franchises in history. Since her debut in 1996, Lara has grown from eye candy to female gaming icon, with great praise particularly directed towards the Crystal Dynamics “Tomb Raider” franchise for humanising Lara’s origin story and evolution into the hardened Tomb Raider we know so well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lara is currently presented to the world by acclaimed writer Rhianna Pratchett, actress Camilla Luddington and Senior Community Manager Meagan Marie.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The first of many sources that inspire us </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the Plastic Wax blog! Here I&#8217;ll be sharing the many facets of life at Plastic &#8211; the people, the projects, our day-to-day life and what inspires us to bring ideas to life.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-295" src="http://plasticwax.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/OW2A7623-300x286.jpg" alt="OW2A7623" width="210" height="200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-535 size-medium" src="http://plasticwax.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OW2A7627-300x200.jpg" alt="OW2A7627" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>For our first entry, what better than the entire planet? This week NASA Astronaut Scott Kelly arrived back on Earth after a year in space. Aside from literally changing the course of human history and opening the doors that could see humanity live on Mars, (no big deal) Kelly sent home some pretty stunning imagery from his time in space.</p>

Our first game cinematic project landed for <b>Ultima Online</b> (One of the first MMO&#8217;s) and this spring boarded onto larger game cinematic projects such as the announcement trailers for <b>Fallout</b>, <b>Borderlands </b>and <b>BioShock</b>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>95% of our client base is international and primarily from the US, with regular clients like Warner Brothers, Disney and Microsoft. One of the first questions we are asked is ‘Why wouldn’t a US company just hire locally?”</p>
<p>And my answer is always talent. There’s incredible and diverse animation talent in Australia that we’re very proud of.</p></blockquote>
